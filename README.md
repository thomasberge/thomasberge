- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @thomasberge
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in webservice architecture and applications (SAAS, restful APIs, OpenAPI), containers (docker), machine learning, LLMs and computer vision, console emulation and preservation, and all other cool stuff you can do on a computer. Especially if it can be done on a Raspberry Pi!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently experimenting building AI-integrated web IOT IDE with Python/Javascript, and playing around with neural networks in Python.
