- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @thomasberge
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in webservices, rest, emulation, containers and all other cool stuff you can do on a computer. Especially if it can be done on a Raspberry Pi!
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning PL/SQL, practicing my python skills and building cool web stuff with dart.
