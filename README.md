- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @thomasberge
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in webservice architecture, OpenAPI and documentation, emulation, containers, machine learning, neural networks and all other cool stuff you can do on a computer. Especially if it can be done on a Raspberry Pi!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Go, experimenting with neural networks with Python and building cool web stuff with Dart.
